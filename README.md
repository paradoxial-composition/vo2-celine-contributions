# Contribution Charts for Celine Projects

This repository contains visual representations of my contributions to various projects under the Celine organization. The charts were generated using a custom script I created, which processes contribution data and outputs detailed visualizations. You can find the script [here]().

## Overview

Below are charts that summarize my contributions for each individual repository, as well as an overall summary chart that aggregates all contributions across the repositories.

### How It Was Made

The charts were generated using a Python script I developed, which automates the process of collecting contribution data from GitHub and visualizing it. The script leverages libraries such as `matplotlib` and `pandas` for data processing and visualization. You can explore the script and its functionality by visiting the [GitHub repository]().
